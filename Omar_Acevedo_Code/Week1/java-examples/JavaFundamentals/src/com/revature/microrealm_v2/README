This MicroRealm created is a development in progress 
for the sole purpose of practicing and testing OOP concepts.

To run it, execute the Simulator java file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where are the Four Pillars of OOP applied in the program?

	 - Inheritance	:	
	 	- "Extends"	:	[ClassName] inherits from [ClassName]
	 					=>	HumanBluePrint inherits from HelperFunctions
	 					=>	Avatar inherits from HumanBluePrint
	 					=>	Simulator inherits from Avatar
	 					
	 	- "Implements"	:	[ClassName] implements [Interface]
	 						=>	HumanBluePrint implements HumanActions

	- Abstraction	:
		- "classes"	:	[ClassName] is [abstract]
						=>	HumanBluePrint is abstract
						=>	Role is abstract	*NOT USED AS OF THIS MOMENT, YET
		- "methods"	:	All methods in Role abstract class, are abstract.
	
	- Encapsulation	:
		- "Private instance variables"	:	Variables in HumanBluePrint and Avatar classes.
		- "Accessors and Mutators"		:	Getters and Setters are in HumanBluePrint and Avatar classes.

	- Polymorphism	:
		- "Overloading, Overriding"			:	Constructor overload happens in Avatar class.
		- "Reference type* | A a = new B()"	:	Happens in Simulator class;
											;	[ Line 72 ] => HumanBluePrint avatar
											;	[ Line 90 ] => avatar = new Avatar(name, gender);
