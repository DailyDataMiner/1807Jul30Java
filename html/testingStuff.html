            <a name="abstraction">
                <h3>1) Abstraction</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Abstraction is a process of exposing essential feature of an entity while hiding other irrelevant detail. Why would you want
                to use abstraction? Abstraction is one of the most important points within any object-oriented language.
                As we are dealing with a representation of a real object (which names the paradigm), we have to imagine what
                that object will perform within our system. There are three points that should be taken into consideration
                in this abstraction.
                <br>
                <br> The first point is to give an identity to the object that we create. This identity must be unique within
                the system so there is no conflict. In most languages, there is the concept of packages (or namespaces).
                In these languages, the identity of the object can not be repeated within the package, not necessarily the
                entire system.
                <br>
                <br> The second part concerns the object's characteristics. As we know, in the real world every object has elements
                that define it. Within the object-oriented programming, these characteristic properties are named. For example,
                the properties of an object "Dog" could be "Size", "Race" and "Age".
                <br>
                <br> Finally, the third part is define the actions that the object will perform. These actions, or events, are
                called methods. These methods can be extremely variable, ranging from "TurnOn()" in a lamp object to "Bark()"
                in a dog object.
                <br>
                <br> Abstraction reduces code complexity and at the same time it makes your aesthetically pleasant.
                <br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <a name="encapsulation">
                <h3>2) Encapsulation</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Encapsulation is one of the main techniques that defines the object-oriented programming. It is one of the elements that
                add security to the application in an object-oriented programming because of hiding the properties, creating
                a sort of black box.
                <br>
                <br> Most object-oriented languages implement encapsulation based on private property, related to special methods
                called getters and setters, which will return and set the property value, respectively. This attitude prevents
                direct access to the object's property by adding another application security layer.
                <br>
                <br> To do a parallel with what we see in the real world, we have encapsulation into other elements. For example,
                when we click the button to connect the television, we do not know what's going on internally. We can then
                say that the methods that connect the TV are encapsulated.
                <br>

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <a name="polymorphism">
                <h3>3) Polymorphism</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Polymorphism refers to the ability to take into different forms or stages. A subclass can define its own unique behavior
                and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class. Yes, you got it right, subclass
                can have their own behavior and share some of its behavior from its parent class not the other way around.
                A parent class cannot have the behavior of its subclass.
                <br>
                <br> Another essential point in object-oriented programming is called polymorphism. In nature, we see animals
                that are capable of changing its shape as needed, and it is this idea that comes polymorphism in object orientation.
                As we know, the child objects inherit the characteristics and actions of their "ancestors". However, in some
                cases, it is necessary that the actions for a same method to be different. In other words, the polymorphism
                consists of changing the inner workings of a method inherited from a parent object.
                <br>
                <br> As an example, we have a generic object "Appliance". This object has a method, or action, "TurnOn()". We
                have two objects, "TV" and "Fridge", which won't be connected in the same way. So you must, for each of the
                child classes, rewrite method "TurnOn()".
                <br>
                <br> Regarding the polymorphism, worth some observations. As this is an issue that is closely connected toinheritance,
                understandboth together is a good idea. Another point is the fact that the programming languages implement
                polymorphism in different ways. C#, for example, makes use of virtual method (with the virtual keyword) which
                can be redeployed (with the override keyword) in the child classes. In Java, only the "@Override" attribute
                is required.
                <br>
                <br> These four pillars are essential in the understanding of any object-oriented language and object orientation
                as a whole. Each language will implement these pillars in a way, but essentially it's the same. Only the
                issue of inheritance, as mentioned, which may bring more rapid changes, such as the presence of multiple
                inheritance. Moreover, encapsulation is also done in different ways in different languages, although the
                getters and setters are almost ubiquitous.
                <br>

            <a name="inheritance">
                <h3>4) Inheritance</h3>
            </a>
            <p>
                Code reuse is one of the great advantages of object-oriented programming. Much of this happens as a matter which is known
                as inheritance. This feature optimizes the production time and the application code lines.
                <br>
                <br> To understand this feature, let's imagine a family: a child, for example, is inheriting characteristics
                from their parents. Parents, in turn, inherit something from grandparents, which means that your child also
                does, and so on. In object orientation, the question is exactly that. The object down the hierarchy will
                inherit characteristics of all the objects above it, their "ancestors". The inheritance from the characteristics
                of the above is considered direct object inheritance, while the others are considered indirect inheritance.
                For example, in the family, the child inherits the parent directly and indirectly grandfather and great-grandfather.
                <br>
                <br> The issue ofinheritancevaries greatly from language to language. In some of them, such as C++, there is
                the issue ofmultiple inheritance. This essentially means that the object can inherit characteristics of various
                "ancestors" while directly. In other words, each object can have as many parents needed. Due to problems,
                this practice was not widespread in most modern languages, using other tricks to create a kind of multiple
                inheritance.
                <br>
                <br> Other object-oriented languages such as C#, bring a base object for everyone else. The object class provides
                features for all objects in C#, are created by the user or not.
