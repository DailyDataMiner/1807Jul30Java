            Strings are one of the most common objects used in Java programming. They are among the only ways that programmers can show readable information
            to their consumers. Generally, a string will represent every word in every sentence, whether displayed to the user, or returned by the user.
            This means that, though a string is not one of the core Java primitives, it is still an extremely important part of Java as a whole, and is treated
            as such by language itself.
            <br>
            Here, we will investigate what a string actually is in Java, what makes it unique, and why programmers might use a few of the string alternatives.

        <p>
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html" target="_blank">Strings</a> are a special type of Java object, but that doesn't mean that they aren't objects. In fact, Java Strings are included in the Java.lang package,
            and they extend the Object class. They also implement the marker interface <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html" target="_blank">Serializable</a>, 
            as well as the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html" target="_blank">Comparable</a> interface used for comparing objects.
            Finally, String implements the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/CharSequence.html" target="_blank">CharSequence</a> interface which allows its implementing classes to represent a sequence of characters. 
            StringBuilder and StringBuffer will also implement this interface.
            <br>
            It is also important to note that the String class is Final and Immutable.
            <br>
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/final.html" target="_blank">Final</a>: The String class cannot be extended.
            <br>
            <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/immutable.html" target="_blank">Immutable</a>: Strings cannot be changed once created.
            <br>
            Because Strings are immutable, a new String must be created every time programmers attempt to manipulate them. This means that even changing one letter
            creates a new String. Luckily, Strings have a special area in memory for their storage, unlike most objects.
            <br>
            This special place in memory is called the String Pool. Though it is on the heap, where all objects are stored, it behaves very differently. The String Pool
            contains only String Literals. Strings and String Literals aren't quite the same thing. As we've gone over, Strings are actually objects, not primitives. When 
            a String Object is created, it is stored on the heap, as usual. String Literals are technically String Objects as well, but they stored in the String Pool to increase
            performance. String Literals are also represented by a character string such as "Hello" instead of the normal 'new String()' used for Objects.
            <br>
            The differences between the two are pretty confusing, but very important. This is because String Literals in the String Pool can be referenced in new String declarations,
            unlike the String Objects, which contain specific references to objects in the heap. In order to best exemplify this, look at the following example.
            <br>
            <br>
            String a = "I am a String Literal";
            <br>
            String b = "I am a String Literal";
            <br>
            String c = new String("I am a String Object");
            <br>
            String d = new String("I am a String Object");
            <br>
            <br>
            Because Strings a and b are both String Literals with the same value, they are actually referencing the same String Literal in the String Pool. However, because
            Strings c and d are String Objects, they are referencing two different Strings on the heap, even though they are the same. Thus, it is almost always better to 
            declare a String using a String Literal than a String Object, to save space in memory.
            <br>
            Finally, Strings have the special ability to be combined together using the "+" operator, unlike most objects. Do note that combining a String in this way still
            creates a new String Literal, because Strings are immutable. For example:
            <br>
            String a = "Hello " + "World!";
            <br>
            creates a new String Literal that reads "Hello World!" as an addition of the two Strings.

    <div id="stringsBuilder" class="p-3 center-block mx-auto mainArea">
        <a name="stringBuilder"></a>
        <h4 class="text-center fancyTextHeaders">StringBuilders</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html" target="_blank">StringBuilders</a> have very similar functionality to Strings, but they have a few important differences. 
        Like Strings, they extend from Object and implement Serializable and CharSequence. Also like Strings, StringBuilders are simply sequences of characters.
        <br>
        However, unlike Strings, StringBuilders are mutable. This means that all StringBuilder character strings can be easily changed without having to create a new StringBuilder.
        As a result, StringBuilders are far better used when a programmer is planning on changing a string.
        <br>
        StringBuilders do have one obvious downside. They aren't Thread-Safe.
        <br>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19455-01/806-5257/6je9h033e/index.html" target="_blank">Thread-Safe</a>: A piece of code is Thread-Safe when multiple threads can access it at once and still function correctly.
        <br>
        This means that, where a StringBuilder is quite fast, it sacrifices its ability to be effective in multithreaded enviroments. 
        <br>
        It should also be noted that StringBuilders are best used when building or changing a string, not actually storing it. Strings have far more functionality than 
        both StringBuilders and StringBuffers, as StringBuilders are mainly used for their fast character inserts, replacements, appends, and deletions. 
        <br>
        StringBuilders are also stored with a specific capacity, which increases as the character array increases. Strings are often stored as String Literals, as we went over
        before, which make them more optimal for referencing and storing.
        </p>

<div id="stringsBuffer" class="p-3 center-block mx-auto mainArea">
    <a name="stringBuffer"></a>
    <h4 class="text-center fancyTextHeaders">StringBuilders</h4>
    <br>
    <p>
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html" target="_blank">StringBuffers</a> are almost identical to StringBuilders in functionality. Like their counterparts, they extend from Object and implement Serializable and CharSequence.
        They are also mutable like StringBuilders.
        <br>
        The main, and really only, difference between the two occurs in their speed and Thread-Safety. StringBuffers are Thread-Safe, unlike StringBuilders, making them
        far more ideal to use in a multithreaded enviroment.
        <br>
        However, like each of these different classes, StringBuffers have their downside. They are a deal slower than Strings and StringBuilders. This means that using many
        StringBuffers can greatly slow down a program in comparison to a program using only Strings or StringBuilders.
