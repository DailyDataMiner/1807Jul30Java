-- The syntax for queries is SELECT [column] FROM [table] WHERE [condition]
select * from artist; -- Can be all caps. is case insensitive

select * from artist where name like 'A%e'; -- You can use the % as a filler for text that isn't there. I.e.
--A% selects anything that begins with A and A%e select anything that begins with A and ends with e

-- Highlighting certain portions of code can let you run just that code

select * from artist where name like 'A_a%';
--This just makes it so the first and third letter has to be a but the second letter can be anything, then you have the % selector afterwards

select * from artist where upper(name) like 'A%M%%';
-- Selects anything that has an A and an M, regardless of case
