		 *BitwiseOr is a binary operator  denoted by |
		 *it compares corresponding bits of two operands. If neither of the bits is 1, it gives 1. if not it gives 0
		 *
		 *example:
		 *12=00001100
		 *25=00011001
		 *
		 *
		 *000
		 * 
		 * ++X this pre incriments so in if (++x == 5)
		 * if i pass in a 5 this will evaluate to true
		 * 
		 * if i pass in 5 to the below it will be incremented before being compared
		 * meaning it would be 6==5 which would be false
		 * x++

		 * Ternary operators --->[expression]?[if yes][if no] :

		 * String greeting= value? "hi" : "bye";
		 * System.out.println(greeting)
		 * 
		 * if value is true print hi if false print bye
