		// A constructor is a special method in Java used to "construct" or
		// create a new instance of the class it is found in. It does not have a
		// return type, and can be overloaded. The first line, whether
		// implicitly or explicitly, is ALWAYS a call to another constructor
		// (either this() or super()). If there is no explicit superclass, it
		// calls the Object class's constructor. If you do not explicitly call
		// this() or super(), JVM interprets the first line as super()
		// implicitly. Regardless of whether you explicitly create a constructor
		// or not, there is ALWAYS a constructor in every concrete class; it is
		// called the default constructor and looks like the "no-args"
		// constructor, but disappears as soon as a constructor is explicitly
		// created.
