		/*Scopes
		 * The lifetime of a variable
		 * There are four different scopes in Java
		 * Class/Static = This is what we usually mean by global
		 * 		Static entities (vars, methods, nested classes_ are 
		 * 		accessible from outside the class without an instance 
		 * 		ie. Class.x or Class.method().
		 * 		Regarding static variables, these variables are shared
		 * 		throughout all instances of the class.
		 * 		Class c = new Class();
		 * 		Class c2 = new Class();
		 * 		c.x == c2.x //true
		 * 		
		 * 
		 * Object/Instance - the object's fields/state
		 * 		Entities in this scope can only be accessed by an instance 
		 * 		of the object they belong to.
		 * 		Ie. Class c - new Class();
		 * 			c.x or c.method();
		 * 			Not Class.method(); . this would be a static method
		 * Method = mostly parameters and any variables defined t the method
		 * 		Variables in this scope exist for the lifetime of a method
		 * 	Loop/Block = any variables defined within curly braces
