types it can take
- int - Integer
- short - Short
- byte	- Byte
- char - Character
- enum

scanners
wrapper classes
strings
arrays
if/else if/else
operators 
exceptions

intance variable needs an object inorder to access a method

FINAL
-class-cannot be extended
-method- CANNOT be overriden -CAN BE OVERLOADED
-variables-cannot be changed once initalized

strings are mutable (final)

stringbuilder -faster- is not thread safe
stringbuffer is thread safe

	WEDNESDAY

abstraction hides implementation
whereas
encapsilation is data restriction

POJO - plain old java object

ABSTRACT
abstract is not access modifier
abstract method - method without implementation

serializable - marker interface
functional interface - has one and only one abstract method

INHERITANCE
-Extend - classes
Cannot extend more than one class
-Implement - interfaces
Can implent more than one interface
-Java does NOT support multiple inheritance (but can do above)

Overriding - same method signature
Overloading - different method signature

POLYMORPHISM
ability of an object to act in different mannars 
based on its reference type or inheiritance stream

OPERATOR
performs operations on operands

Tertiary operands - look up

errors that you make happen on runtime (exception)
